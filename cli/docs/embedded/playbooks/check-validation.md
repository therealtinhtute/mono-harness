# Playbook: check (Validation evidence)

Loaded by `docs/playbooks/check-durable.md` step 8.

## Validation Entry Format

```markdown
- <UTC> — phase `<phase-slug>` — verdict: APPROVED — mode: gate
  - `<command>` — <result in at most 3 lines>
  - scope: on target | drift | incomplete — <one line>
  - requirements: R1 met (<proof>) | R2 not met (<gap>) | R3 partial (→ <phase>)
  - rollback_point: <commit the phase can be reverted to>
  - requests: none | <numbered findings with path:line>
  - not_independently_verified: <aspect> (same-session only)
  - judge: independent | same-session
  - judge_model: <model identifier>
```

Every Validation entry must include timestamp, stable phase slug, exact command/result and concise output, plus every field above. Two positions are load-bearing, so the commit-time guard can find them:

- The first line carries the anchored token `verdict: <VERDICT>`. Anywhere else it is silently skipped.
- Each proof is a sub-bullet indented two or more spaces that starts with the bare command in single backticks: no label before it, no double backticks, no backtick inside the command.

Validation is append-only from an entry's first commit; never replace committed evidence. The one exception is closing compaction (`handoff.md` step 6), which keeps the last entry per phase byte-identical. An uncommitted entry may still be reshaped.

**Proof re-execution contract** — each proof re-runs from the repository root under `sh -c` on a bare checkout: no prior `cd`, virtualenv, or alias (carry them inline: `cd cli && cargo test`; bash-only syntax → `bash -c '…'`). It must not depend on environment variables, binary presence, or OS version. Timeout 300 s when `timeout`/`gtimeout` exists.

## What the Guards Cannot Check

Name any that applies in `proof_gaps:`: `judge: independent` is testimony; an unparsed verdict is ignored, not rejected; an entry added and removed inside one push is unseen; a `requirements:` line is testimony, and the proof it cites re-runs only as a proof sub-bullet.
