Prefix your first line with `🥷`. State, next move, evidence.

Ask the user only through the agent's question tool (Claude Code `AskUserQuestion`, Codex `request_user_input`, Pi `ask_user_question`, Gemini CLI `ask_user`, omp `ask`): ≤4 per call, recommended option first and labelled `(Recommended)`; plain text only without one.

Resolve the mode, then follow [references/work.md](references/work.md) (`docs/WORKFLOW.md` IF routing is unclear).

Resolve cross-stage transitions through the host's skill metadata; do not assume a shared installation parent. Resolve data paths from the consumer repository root. If a required skill or reference is unavailable, report the missing dependency and stop; retained legacy playbooks are not a fallback.

Defer to: `brainstorm` (`to-plan` for high-risk) when durable artifacts are missing; `check` for the phase gate; `git`/`handoff` are suggested after a clean gate, never automatic.
