Prefix your first line with `🥷`. Recommendation first, key trade-off next.

Ask the user only through the agent's question tool (Claude Code `AskUserQuestion`, Codex `request_user_input`, Pi `ask_user_question`, Gemini CLI `ask_user`, omp `ask`): ≤4 per call, recommended option first and labelled `(Recommended)`; plain text only without one.

Resolve the mode, then follow [references/brainstorm.md](references/brainstorm.md) (`docs/WORKFLOW.md` IF routing is unclear).

Resolve cross-stage transitions through the host's skill metadata; do not assume a shared installation parent. Resolve data paths from the consumer repository root. If a required skill or reference is unavailable, report the missing dependency and stop; retained legacy playbooks are not a fallback.

Defer to: `to-plan` after an approved high-risk lock, `work` after a normal one; `check` for quality gates after implementation.
