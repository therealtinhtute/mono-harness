# record-check.sh — convenience proof runner for ## Validation entries (R2 companion)
#
# NOT the guarantee. The pre-commit hook re-executes every proof command of a
# newly added APPROVED/APPROVE_WITH_REQUESTS entry from staged bytes itself and
# reads no marker. This script only lets an agent sanity-run the exact commands
# it is about to cite, under identical semantics: `sh -c`, 5-minute timeout per
# command (timeout → gtimeout → unbounded, same resolver as the pre-commit hook),
# exit 0 required.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/record-check.sh [-t SECONDS] -- "cmd1" "cmd2" ...
#   echo '"cmd1\ncmd2"' | jq -r .[] | ...   # not supported; pass commands as args
#
# Exit codes: 0 all proofs pass; 1 at least one failed; 2 usage error.
