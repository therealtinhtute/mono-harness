# Playbook: check

Durable `gate` runs automated checks and records the verdict in `## Validation`; `work` runs it after every phase. `full` includes the gate and adds the complete Security, Performance, Architecture, and Code Quality review, once, on the final phase.

## Preconditions and Modes

1. Preserve invocation intent:
   - `auto` (default) — a direct change → resolve to `bounded` without reading any plan; a named durable initiative → `gate`, and invalid initiative state never falls back to `bounded`. Ambiguous → ask. `auto` never resolves to `full`, and an active plan's mere existence never selects `gate`.
   - `gate`, `full` (never run by `work`), `bounded` (aliases: `simple`, `review`).
2. Durable → read `docs/playbooks/check-durable.md` now.
3. After the preflight succeeds, print the resolved mode before running checks or writing state: `mode: {resolved} ({reason})`. A failed preflight reports its blocker instead.

**Zero-write rule:** `bounded` is always response-only and never appends to Validation. Invocation intent wins: an active plan never upgrades `bounded`.

## Steps

1. **Load scope** — the diff and verification commands; gate/full also the phase and the `## Log`/`## Validation` tails.
2. **Classify** — depth by blast radius; scope on target, drift, or incomplete (a surface violation blocks a clean verdict).
3. **Run the automated gate** — tests, types, lint, build, in repository order. IF `scripts/record-check.sh` exists → `bash scripts/record-check.sh -- "cmd1" "cmd2"`; else keep each exit code (never let a pipe hide it). Cite the raw commands.
4. **Plan alignment** (gate/full) — `check-durable.md` step 4.
5. **Manual review** — `gate` does not perform that complete manual review. `full`, or `bounded` on a diff: read `docs/playbooks/check-review.md` now.
6. **Proof classes** — `tiny`: output; `normal`: + unit; `high-risk`: + integration, manual review. Name gaps.
7. **Verdict** — critical issue or plan contradiction → `REQUEST_CHANGES`; major findings → at least `APPROVE_WITH_REQUESTS`; else `APPROVED`. Declare the judge (`same-session` IF you authored the diff, else `independent`) and the model. A `same-session` approval names one aspect not independently verified. `full` and `high-risk` require `judge: independent`.
8. **Evidence and plan state** (gate/full) — `check-durable.md` steps 8–11.

## Output Format

```text
mode: gate | full | bounded
depth: quick | standard | deep
scope: on target | drift | incomplete
gate: pass | fail
verdict: APPROVED | APPROVE_WITH_REQUESTS | REQUEST_CHANGES
judge: independent | same-session (judge_model: {model identifier})
enforcement: hook | ci | local-only
verification: exact command -> pass | fail | not-run
proof_gaps: none | exact missing classes
```
